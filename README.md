# MAXIM AI Documentation
This is the “home” for IC, EV Kit, SDK, and AI documentation for the Maxim AI product family.

**START HERE:**

->->-> **[Getting Started with the MAX78000 Evaluation Kit](./MAX78000_Evaluation_Kit/README.md)**

->->-> **[Getting Started with the MAX78000 Feather Board](./MAX78000_Feather/README.md)**


## Project Structure

The project consists of four repositories:

1. This repo (“Documentation”)
2. The software development kit (SDK), which contains drivers and example programs ready to run on the Evaluation Kit:
   [MAX78000_SDK](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MAX78000_SDK)
3. The training repo, which is used for deep learning model development and training:
   [ai8x-training](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-training)
4. The synthesis repo, which is used to convert a trained model into C code using the “izer” tool:
   [ai8x-synthesis](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis)
