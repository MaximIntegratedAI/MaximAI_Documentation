## Introduction

This quick-start document contains info on getting started with the MAX78002EVKIT evaluation platform. It supplements the full MAX78002EVKIT datasheet with information on software development and quick tips for getting started.

## Schematic and BOM

The schematic and BOM can be found in the [MAX78002 EVKIT web page](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/microcontrollers/MAX78002EVKIT.html)

## First-time Firmware Updates

The firmware for the MAX32625PICO (PICO) debug adapter should be updated before using the MAX78002EVKIT. These updates contain bug fixes and improvements that are required to ensure proper operation of the kit.

### Updating the MAX32625PICO (PICO) Debug Adapter Firmware

1. Download the [`max32625_max78000fthr_if_crc_v1.0.2.bin`](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/raw/master/MAX78002_Evaluation_Kit/MAX32625PICO_files/max32625_max78000fthr_if_crc_v1.0.2.bin) file.

    If you have cloned this repository, the file can also be found in the `MAX78002_Evaluation_Kit/MAX32625PICO_files` folder.

2. Connect the included micro-USB cable to the PICO _without_ connecting the other side of the cable to your host PC yet.

    <img src="img/pico_partial_connected.jpg" alt="PICO Partially Connected" width="400"/>

3. Press and hold the pushbutton on the top of the PICO.

    <img src="img/pico_pushbutton.jpg" alt="PICO Pushbutton" width="400"/>

4. _While holding down the pushbutton on the PICO_ connect the other side of the micro-USB cable to your host PC. 

    Keep the pushbutton held down until the LED on the PICO blinks and becomes solid.

    <img src="img/pico_connected.jpg" alt="PICO Connected" width="400"/>

5. A `MAINTENANCE` drive should now appear on your file system.

    <img src="img/MAINTENANCE.jpg" alt="Maintenance Drive Image" width="400"/>

6. Drag and drop the [`max32625_max78000fthr_if_crc_v1.0.2.bin`](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/raw/master/MAX78002_Evaluation_Kit/MAX32625PICO_files/max32625_max78000fthr_if_crc_v1.0.2.bin) file onto the `MAINTENANCE` drive. This will flash the PICO with the updated firmware.

    <img src="img/MAINTENANCE.jpg" alt="Maintenance Drive Image" width="400"/>

    <img src="img/drag_and_drop.JPG" alt="Drag and Drop" width="400"/>

    <img src="img/pico_flashing.JPG" alt="Flashing" width="400"/>

7. Once the flashing is complete, the PICO will restart and present itself as a `DAPLINK` drive.

    <img src="img/DAPLINK.jpg" alt="Daplink Drive" width="400"/>

8. Open the `DAPLINK` drive.

    <img src="img/DAPLINK_opened.jpg" alt="Daplink Opened" width="400"/>

9. Open the `DETAILS.TXT` file and verify the contents match the [`MAX32625PICO_files/DETAILS.TXT`](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/raw/master/MAX78002_Evaluation_Kit/MAX32625PICO_files/DETAILS.TXT) file in this repository. Specifically - the “Git SHA” field should match exactly.

    <img src="img/DETAILS_Git_SHA.jpg" alt="Details GIT SHA" width="400"/>

10. Your PICO debugger is now ready to use with the MAX78002EVKIT.

## Powering and Connecting to the Evaluation Kit

### Power Supply

The MAX78002EVKIT requires an external 5V supply power supply. A 5V wall adapter is supplied in the box. Connect the 5V wall adapter to the “5V IN” barrel jack connector (J1). 


<img src="img/J1.jpg" alt="J1" width="550"/>

SW1 (labeled “PWR”) is the main power switch. With 5VIN supplied, flip the switch to power the rest of the board. The “5V” status LED (D2), “1V1 CNN” (D4), and “3V3” (D3) status LEDs will turn on and can be used to verify the board is powered on successfully.

<img src="img/Power_LEDs.jpg" alt="Power LEDs" width="550"/>

### Connecting Debug Adapters

The MAX78002 is a dual-core microcontroller, with both an Arm Cortex M4 core and a RISC-V core. As a result, the EVKIT comes with two debug adapters:

A MAX32625PICO:

* For use with the Arm Cortex M4 core
* Connects to the “SWD” debug header (JH8)

<img src="img/pico_swd_connected.jpg" alt="PICO SWD Connected" width="550"/>

An Olimex [ARM-USB-OCD-H](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-USB-OCD-H/) + [ARM-JTAG 20-10 adapter](https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/):

* For use with the RISC-V core
* Connects to the “RV JTAG” debug header (JH5)
* This RISC-V debug adapter needs to be connected only for debugging the RISC-V core, but not for loading in general. Many of the examples in the MaximSDK are Arm-only.
* RISC-V debugging does, in general, also require simultaneous debugging of the Arm M4 core.

<img src="img/Olimex.jpg" alt="Olimex Debugger Connected" width="550"/>

### Connecting Serial Ports

The MAX78002EVKIT exposes 3 serial ports via micro-USB connectors.

### “USB/UART” (CN2)

This serial port routes UART0 and UART1 from the MAX78002 to an [FT231XS](https://ftdichip.com/products/ft231xs/) UART to USB adapter. This is the default serial port used by most examples.

To communicate over this port, connect a micro-USB cable from the host PC to CN2. Most Operating Systems will auto-install the required drivers or already include them on the system, and the FT231XS chip will present itself as a Virtual COM Port (VCP). 

If the port does _not_ present itself, then manual driver installation is required. See [this](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/) page from the official FTDI site.

ADI’s examples use the following serial communication settings by default:

* BAUD Rate: 115200
* Data: 8-bit
* Parity: None
* Stop bits: 1
* Flow control: None

Serial communication settings can be modified in the `MaximSDK/Libraries/Boards/MAX78002/EvKit_V1/Include/board.h` file. Jumper settings should be checked when modifying the default settings, such as changing from UART0 to UART1. Refer to the [MAX78002 EVKIT Datasheet](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/microcontrollers/MAX78002EVKIT.html) for more details on jumper settings.

### “USB/AI” (CN3)

This serial port connects directly to the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Controller peripheral on the MAX78002. The serial port will not be functional unless the host firmware running on the MAX78002 sets it up.

### “USB/PWR MON” (CN1)

This serial port connects to a secondary MAX32625 microcontroller that manages the power monitoring sub-circuit of the MAX78002EVKIT. This port will present itself as a standard USB Serial Device.

### Connecting Camera Modules

#### Pcam 5C

The MAX78002EVKIT includes a Pcam 5C CSI camera module, which should be connected to the CSI connector J8 for evaluation.

1. Connect the CSI ribbon cable to the Pcam 5C.

    Looking at the bottom of the Pcam 5C board, the blue strip of the ribbon cable should be facing you.

    <img src="img/pcam_bottom.jpg" alt="Pcam 5C Bottom" width="550"/>

2. Connect the CSI ribbon cable to the CSI connector J8 on the MAX78002EVKIT.

    Slide out the thin darker part of the connector to open it, then insert the ribbon cable.

    The blue strip of the ribbon cable should be facing up.

    Snap the thin darker part of the connector to close it and lock the cable in place.

    <img src="img/csi_connector.jpg" alt="CSI Connector" width="550"/>

3. Remove the cap from the CSI camera module before using it.

    <img src="img/pcam_top.jpg" alt="Pcam Top" width="550"/>

#### OVM7692

The MAX78002EVKIT also comes with an OVM7692 DVP (Digital Video Port) camera module, which should be connected to the DVP connector JH7 for evaluation. This camera also requires an external adapter board which is included with the MAX78002EVKIT.

1. Insert the OVM7692 camera module into JH2 on the DVP adapter board.

    The camera module should be facing toward the outer edge of the adapter board.

    <img src="img/DVP_1.jpg" alt="DVP Camera Module Face" width="550"/>

    <img src="img/DVP_2.jpg" alt="DVP Camera Module Top" width="550"/>

2. Remove the small amber cover sticker from the OVM7692 camera module to expose the lens.

    <img src="img/OVM7692.jpg" alt="DVP Camera Module Cover Removed" width="550"/>

3. Remove the plastic cover from the DVP port of the adapter board and attach one side of the included DVP cable.

    Use the end of the cable with the notch such that the cable comes out from the adapter board.

    <img src="img/DVP_3.jpg" alt="DVP Cable on Adapter" width="550"/>

4. Attach the other side of the DVP cable to JH7 on the MAX78002EVKIT.

    **It should be noted that removing the cable after fully inserting it into JH7 can very easily damage it.** To safely remove the DVP cable use a small flat-head to push out the plastic notch. **Do no remove the cable by pulling on the cable wire itself.**

    <img src="img/DVP_4.jpg" alt="DVP Cable on EVKIT" width="550"/>

## First-time Operation

The MAX78002EVKIT will come pre-flashed with a Keyword-spotting demo program out of the box. This demo showcases the “kws20” Neural Network, which has been trained on Google’s speech commands dataset to recognize the following 20 keywords:

 **up, down, left, right, stop, go, yes, no, on, off, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, zero**

To excercise the demo power on the EVKIT and follow the instructions on the TFT display.

Optionally, connect to the USB/UART (CN2) [Serial port](#Connecting-serial-ports) to monitor the serial output of the demo program.

The source code for the demo can be found in the `Examples/MAX78002/CNN/kws20_demo` folder of the MaximSDK.

## Software Development Quick-Start

### Setup

Embedded development for the MAX78002EVKIT is enabled by the Maxim Microcontroller SDK (“MaximSDK”).

The MaximSDK can be downloaded and installed from the following links:

* [Windows](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/software-description.html/swpart=SFW0010820A)
* [Linux](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/software-description.html/swpart=SFW0018720A)
* [MacOS](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/software-description.html/swpart=SFW0018610A)

More detailed setup instructions for the MaximSDK can be found in the “Embedded Software Development Kit (SDK)” section of the ai8x-synthesis readme [here](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis/blob/develop/README.md#embedded-software-development-kit-sdk).

### Example Projects

Example projects for the MAX78002EVKIT can be found in the `MaximSDK/Examples/MAX78002` folder of the MaximSDK installation.

<img src="img/examples_folder.jpg" alt="Examples Folder" width="550"/>

Each example project contains a `README.md` file explaining what the example does. “Out of the box” each example is set up for command-line development, Visual Studio Code, and Eclipse. In general, the examples are organized into folder names that are based on the peripheral that it demonstrates.

### SDK Documentation and Peripheral API

Additional documentation on the MAX78002’s peripheral API and example projects can be found by opening the `MaximSDK/Documentation/MAX78002.html` file in your browser. This root file contains shortcuts to documentation on the peripheral API, toolchain documentation, example applications, datasheets, and schematics.

The peripheral API documentation is particularly useful and contains full module references. This document is useful to reference when examining the MAX78002 example projects and/or developing new projects around the peripheral drivers.

<img src="img/docs_peripheral_api.jpg" alt="Peripheral API" width="550"/>

### Debugger Limitations of the MAX78002

Before continuing into the development quick-starts below, it’s important to note some limitations when debugging the MAX78002:

* The debugger can not be connected to the MAX78002 _while_ the device is in reset.
* The MAX78002 can not be debugged while the device is in Sleep, Low Power Mode, Micro Power Mode, Standby, Backup, or Shutdown mode. 

    These modes shut down the SWD clock.

    Examples that enter these modes have a 2-second delay in place at the beginning of code execution to give the debugger a window to connect. For low-power development, it is also recommended to have the same delay in place.

These limitations may make the device difficult (or impossible) for the debugger to connect in certain states. In such cases, the device can be recovered from the “locked out” firmware by erasing the application-space in the flash memory bank. See [How to Unlock a MAX78000 That Can No Longer Be Programmed](#how-to-unlock-a-max78002-that-can-no-longer-be-programmed).

### Command-Line Development

This section demonstrates how to build the MaximSDK example projects for the MAX78002EVKIT on the command line. It also demonstrates how to flash and debug over the command-line.

This section is presented first because all of the IDEs supported by the MaximSDK rely on a functional command-line toolchain. Familiarity with the inner workings of the command-line can facilitate better experiences with the IDEs. However, this is by no means required reading to use those IDEs.

#### Building Examples

The MaximSDK build system is a managed system that uses GNU Make. Every example project contains a `Makefile` that is used to build the source code. The [GNU Make manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) is a good document to bookmark when working with Makefiles. The example projects in the `Examples/MAX78002` directory of the MaximSDK contain Makefiles that are preconfigured for the MAX78002EVKIT.

1. First, copy the example project to an accessible directory outside of the SDK. It is strongly recommended to keep the MaximSDK examples “clean” and unmodified in case they need to be referenced again later.

2. Launch your terminal. On Windows, use the `MaximSDK/Tools/MSYS2/msys.bat` file to launch the MSYS2 terminal, which auto-configures the terminal for the MaximSDK toolchain. On Linux and MacOS, you should have set up the toolchain for your terminal as part of the setup procedure.

3. `cd` into the location of the copied example project.

4. Run the following command to build the example:

    ```shell
    make -r -j 8 all
    ```

    * “-r” is an option that improves build speed.
    * “-j 8” enabled parallel execution of the build in 8 threads. In general, this number should be double the number of cores on your machine.
    * “all” is the target for building “all” of the source code.

5. You’ll see the source code for the project and the MaximSDK peripheral drivers being compiled on the terminal output. Finally, the compiled source code will be linked into the build output file (`build/max78002.elf`).

6. The example project is now successfully built and ready to flash and debug.

#### Flashing Examples

1. First, build the example project if you have not done so already (See the section above).

2. Connect the PICO debugger to the SWD debugger port (See [Connecting Debug Adapters](#connecting-debug-adapters)).

3. Launch your terminal. On Windows, use the `MaximSDK/Tools/MSYS2/msys.bat` file to launch the MSYS2 terminal.

4. `cd` into the location of the copied example project.

5. Run the one of the following commands to flash the program with OpenOCD.

    * Flash and exit:

        ```shell
        openocd -s $MAXIM_PATH/Tools/OpenOCD/scripts -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/max78002.cfg -c "program build/max78002.elf verify exit"
        ```

        Use this command if you just want to flash the program. OpenOCD will exit on completion.

#### Debugging Examples

1. Flash the example program using the “Flash and hold” command above if you have not done so already.

2. Launch a _new_ terminal. On Windows, use the `MaximSDK/Tools/MSYS2/msys.bat` file to launch a new MSYS2 terminal.

3. `cd` into the location of the copied example project. The next steps will use the “Hello World” project as an example.

4. Run the following command to launch a GDB client.

    ```shell
    arm-none-eabi-gdb --se=build/max78002.elf
    ```

    * “--se” sets the symbol and executable file to the compiled program file. If you’ve changed the name of the output file the command above should change accordingly.

    Expected output:

    ```shell

    (gdb) 
    ```

5. Next, connect to the OpenOCD server that is running in the other terminal window with the following command.

    ```shell
    target extended-remote localhost:3333
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```shell
    Remote debugging using localhost:3333
    0x0000fff4 in ?? () <-- Note: ?? may be present at this stage, which is OK.
    ```

6. (Optional) Reset the MAX78002. 

    ```shell
    monitor reset halt
    ```

    If you have just come from running the “Flash and hold” command, the MAX78002 should already be reset and halted.
    However, it is always good practice to reset and halt the micro core before debugging.

    Expected output:

    ```shell
    SWD DPIDR 0x2ba01477
    target halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread
    xPSR: 0x81000000 pc: 0x0000fff4 msp: 0x20003ff0
    ```

7. Set a breakpoint on main.

    ```shell
    b main
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```shell
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x10000224: file main.c, line 62.
    Note: automatically using hardware breakpoints for read-only addresses.
    ```

8. Continue the debugger.

    ```shell
    continue
    ```

    Expected output (for the Hello World example):

    ```shell
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:62
    62     printf("Hello World!\n");
    ```

9. (Optional) Continue debugging.

    At this stage, the debugger is connected properly and the program is halted on the `main` function. 
    You can continue debugging freely from here.
    See [Common GDB Commands](#Common GDB Commands) below for a quick reference

10. Quit GDB.

    ```shell
    quit
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```shell
    A debugging session is active.

      Inferior 1 [Remote target] will be detached.

    Quit anyway? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
    Detaching from program: C:\Users\Jake.Carter\codespace\Hello_World\build\max78002.elf, Remote target
    [Inferior 1 (Remote target) detached]
    ```

11. Quit OpenOCD. In the terminal window running OpenOCD, press “CTRL + C” to issue the shutdown command.

### Developing with Visual Studio Code

The MaximSDK includes Visual Studio Code (“VS Code”) support via the [VSCode-Maxim](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim) project.

All MAX78002 example projects come “out of the box” with the latest VSCode-Maxim project files and documentation. These can be found in the `.vscode` folder inside each example. The example projects all come pre-configured for the MAX78002EVKIT by default. However, some basic one-time setup is required for Visual Studio Code:

#### VSCode-Maxim Setup

Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim#installation) from the VSCode-Maxim readme. This is a required step to use the VSCode-Maxim project files.

#### Opening Example Projects

1. First, copy the example project from the `Examples/MAX78002` folder in the MaximSDK installation to an accessible directory outside of the SDK. It is strongly recommended to keep the MaximSDK examples “clean” and unmodified in case they need to be referenced again later.

2. Launch Visal Studio Code. You should have already configured VS Code for use with the MaximSDK as part of the setup procedure. If not, follow the Setup section above before continuing.

3. Navigate to “File -> Open Folder...”

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/main/img/file_openfolder.JPG" alt="Open Folder" width="550"/>

4.  Navigate to the location of the copied example project from step 1 and hit “Select Folder”.
5. The project should now be opened in Visual Studio Code. For example:

    <img src="img/VSCode_helloworld.jpg" alt="VS Code Opened" width="550"/>

6. Documentation (`readme.md`) and settings files can be found in the `.vscode` sub-folder of the example project.

    <img src="img/VSCode_folder.jpg" alt="VS Code Folder" width="550"/>

#### VSCode-Maxim Usage

Detailed usage instructions can be found in the [Usage](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim#usage) section of the VSCode-Maxim readme.

Additionally, a full [User Guide](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedTechSupport/VSCode-Maxim/blob/main/userguide.md) is available.

### Developing with Eclipse

#### Eclipse Setup

The only setup required to use Eclipse is to ensure that the “Eclipse” component is selected during the MaximSDK installation. If the MaximSDK is already installed, the component can be added by launching the “MaintenanceTool” application in the root directory of the MaximSDK and selecting “Add or the remove components”.

#### Running Eclipse

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you must launch Eclipse from the _Windows Start Menu_ or the `MaximSDK/Tools/Eclipse/cdt/eclipse.bat` file. This `eclipse.bat` file calls the `setenv.bat` script in the root directory of the SDK before launching Eclipse, which makes the MaximSDK toolchain accessible. Eclipse will fail to find the MaximSDK toolchain binaries unless it is launched with this method.

<img src="img/eclipse_start.jpg" alt="Eclipse Link in Start Menu" width="550"/>

#### Importing an Example

1. Launch Eclipse.

2. Use “File -> Import” to open the import wizard.

3. Select “General -> Existing Projects into Workspace” and hit “Next”.

    <img src="img/import.png" alt="Import Menu" width="550"/>

4. “Select root directory” and hit the “Browse” button.

    <img src="img/eclipse_browse.jpg" alt="Browse Button" width="550"/>

5. Browse to the `Examples/MAX78002` folder in the MaximSDK installation, and then into the example project you would like to import.

    For example, the `Hello_World` Project:

    <img src="img/eclipse_helloworld_import.jpg" alt="Import Hello World" width="550"/>

    or the Keyword-Spotting (`kws20_demo`) CNN project. CNN projects are found in the `CNN` subfolder.

    <img src="img/eclipse_import_kws.jpg" alt="Import KWS20" width="550"/>

6. Ensure that “Copy projects into workspace” is always selected when you import. This will ensure that the MaximSDK copy of the example remains “clean” and unmodified.

    <img src="img/eclipse_copyprojects.jpg" alt="Copy Projects" width="550"/>

7. Select “Finish” to import the project.

8. It should now show up in the Project Explorer.

    <img src="img/eclipse_project_explorer.jpg" alt="Project Explorer" width="550"/>

9. The Eclipse projects files are configured for the MAX78002EVKIT by default. This can be verified by opening the project properties and navigating to “C/C++ Build -> Environment”:

    <img src="img/eclipse_project_properties.jpg" alt="Project Properties" width="550"/>

    * `BOARD` should be set to `EvKit_V1`
    * `TARGET` should be set to `MAX78002`

10. The example is now successfully imported. From here, you may edit, build, and debug the project.

#### Creating a New Project

1. Launch Eclipse

2. Ensure that the Eclipse is set to the C/C++ perspective in the top right corner. Otherwise, the new project wizard will not show up.

    <img src="img/eclipse_perspective.jpg" alt="Eclipse Perspective" width="550"/>

3. Navigate to “File -> New -> Maxim Microcontrollers”.

    <img src="img/eclipse_new_project.jpg" alt="New Project" width="550"/>

4. Enter the project name and hit “Next”.

    <img src="img/eclipse_project_name.jpg" alt="Project Name" width="550"/>

5. Enter the following settings, optionally changing the “Select example type” option to change the example that the new project will copy.

    <img src="img/eclipse_project_configuration.jpg" alt="Project Configuration" width="550"/>

6. Select “Finish” to create the new project. From here, you may edit, build, and debug the project.

#### Building a Project

Use the “Build” button in the top left corner of the window to build a project in Eclipse. 

<img src="img/eclipse_build.jpg" alt="Eclipse Build Button" width="550"/>

Eclipse will use the project Makefile with the “make” command set in “C/C++ Build” project properties setting. 

As shown below, the default “make” target is “all”.

<img src="img/eclipse_build_properties.jpg" alt="Eclipse Build Properties" width="550"/>

#### Debugging

Ensure that you have connected your debugger and powered on the MAX78002EVKIT before proceeding. See [Connecting Debug Adapters](#connecting-debug-adapters).

A project can be debugged by clicking the “Debug” button in the top left corner of the window, next to the “Build” button. This button will launch the currently selected debug configuration (circled in blue below). It is important to ensure that the debug configuration you have selected matches the project you would like to debug.

<img src="img/eclipse_debug.jpg" alt="Eclipse Debug" width="550"/>

The debugger can be stopped with the red “Stop” button next to the “Debug” button.

#### Additional Usage Info for Eclipse

Additional usage information for Eclipse can be found in the [Getting Started with Eclipse](https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/TUT6245.pdf) document.

### How to Unlock a MAX78002 That Can No Longer Be Programmed

Some [debugger limitations](#debugger-limitations-of-the-max78002) may make the device difficult to connect to. In such cases, the device can be recovered from the “locked out” firmware by erasing the application-space in the flash memory bank.

Before following the procedure below, ensure that you have updated the PICO debugger firmware to the latest version. See [Updating the MAX32625PICO (PICO) Debug Adapter Firmware](#updating-the-max32625pico-pico-debug-adapter-firmware)

1. Connect the PICO debugger to the MAX78002 EVKIT SWD debugger port. See [Connecting Debug Adapters](#connecting-debug-adapters) for more detailed instructions on this step.

2. Connect the PICO debugger to the host PC with the included micro-USB cable.

3. Open the DAPLINK` drive on the host PC.

    <img src="img/DAPLINK.jpg" alt="DAPLINK Drive" width="550"/>

4. Open the `DETAILS.TXT` inside of the `DAPLINK` drive in a text editor.

    <img src="img/DAPLINK_opened.jpg" alt="DETAILS.TXT" width="550"/>

5. Verify that the “Automation allowed” field is set to 1.

    <img src="img/DETAILS_automation_allowed.jpg" alt="Automation Allowed" width="550"/>

    If this field is _not_ set to 1, follow the procedure below:
    
    1. Create a new _empty_ file, and save it as `auto_on.cfg`.

    2. Press and hold the pushbutton on top of the PICO.

        <img src="img/pico_pushbutton.jpg" alt="PICO Pushbutton" width="550"/>

    3. _While holding the pushbutton_, drag and drop the `auto_on.cfg` file onto the `DAPLINK` drive.

        <img src="img/auto_on.cfg.jpg" alt="auto_on.cfg" width="550"/>

    3. Continue holding the pushbutton until the file is finished transferring over, then release it.

    4. The PICO should power cycle, and the DAPLINK drive should re-appear with “Automation allowed” set to 1.

6. Power on the MAX78002EVKIT (if it isn’t already).

7. Drag and drop the [`MAX32625PICO_files/erase.act`](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/raw/master/MAX78002_Evaluation_Kit/MAX32625PICO_files/erase.act) file onto the `DAPLINK` drive.

    <img src="img/erase.act.jpg" alt="Erase.act" width="550"/>

8. The PICO debugger will mass erase the MAX78002’s application-space flash bank, which will completely wipe any application firmware that is programmed on the device.

9. Power cycle the MAX78002EVKIT. The MAX78002 is now blank and ready to re-program. The debugger should have no issues connecting to the device in this blank state.

Note:  In order to avoid the locked out state to begin with, it is recommended that during code development, a delay be placed at the beginning of user code in order to give the debug adapter an opportunity to communicate with or halt the processor. A delay of 2 seconds is ideal so that the debugger can be attached manually.

## Power Monitor Sub-Circuit

The MAX78002EVKIT includes a dedicated power-monitoring sub-circuit that allows the user to measure the power consumption of the MAX78002. This separate sub-circuit can be found in the bottom right corner of the board and has its own TFT display, serial port, and microcontroller.

<img src="img/PMON.jpg" alt="Power Monitor Sub-circuit" width="550"/>

### Firmware Updates

The latest version of the power monitor sub-circuit’s firmware is v1.5b. When the MAX78002EVKIT is powered on, this version number should be visible on the TFT display. If the version number is outdated, then the sub-circuit’s firmware must be updated to the latest version before using it.

1. Power off the MAX78002EVKIT.

2. Connect the included micro-USB cable between the “USB/PWR MON” (CN1) connector on the board and the host PC.

3. Press and hold the SW2 pushbutton found inside the sub-circuit on the bottom edge of the board.

4. _While holding SW2_ power the MAX78002EVKIT back on.

5. Hold SW2 until the power monitor’s status LED finishes blinking and becomes solid.

6. A `MAINTENANCE` drive should now appear on your file system.

    <img src="img/MAINTENANCE.jpg" alt="MAINTENANCE DRIVE" width="550"/>

7. Drag and drop the [`PMON_Firmware/max32625_pmon_v15b_if.bin`](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/raw/master/MAX78002_Evaluation_Kit/PMON_Firmware/max32625_pmon_v15b_if.bin) file on to the `MAINTENANCE` drive.

8. Once the file transfer is complete, the MAINTENANCE drive should disappear and the power monitor’s microcontroller restarts. 

    On restart, the TFT display should come online with the latest functional firmware (v1.5b).

    The power monitor sub-circuit is now ready to use.

### Power Monitor Usage

Detailed usage information on the power monitor sub-circuit can be found [here](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/blob/master/MAX78000_Evaluation_Kit/MAX78000%20Power%20Monitor%20and%20Energy%20Benchmarking%20Guide.pdf).

## Machine Learning (ML) Development

The quick-start development sections aboved have covered the "embedded" side of development with the MAX78002EVKIT. This includes working with example projects, peripheral driver APIs, and the IDEs and toolchain supported by the MaximSDK.

As the MAX78002 contains a powerful Convolution Neural Network (CNN) accelerator, there is also the Machine Learning side of development with the part. This is done with a separate set of tools. The example projects that are found in the `CNN` sub-folder of the MAX78002 examples have been created with these tools. More specifically, they have been created with the `ai8x-synthesis` (“izer”) tool, which converts a trained model into C code that can be compiled and flashed onto the MAX78002 using the “embedded” development methods discussed in this document.

### ML Overview

The documentation associated with the setup and usage of these tools is significant. Here are the links to get started:

* [Analog Devices AI Github Repository](https://github.com/maximintegratedAI)
* [ai8x-synthesis tool](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis)
* [ai8x-training tool](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-training)
* [Workflow Guide](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/blob/master/Guides/MAX78000_Workflow_Guide.md#max78000-workflow-guide)

### ML Videos

A large technical library of technical training videos on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the MAX78000/MAX78002 is available via the links below. These are the best way to get started with ML on the MAX78002.

* [Artificial Intelligence Videos Page](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/microcontrollers/artificial-intelligence.html/tab4)
* The “Understanding Artifical Intelligence” series is highly recommended for all developers.

### ML Setup

The setup and usage of the machine learning tools is thoroughly documented in the [README.md](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis/blob/develop/README.md) file that can be found in the root directory of both the “izer” and training tools. See the [Installation](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-training/blob/develop/README.md#installation) section for detailed instructions.

### ML Usage

Detailed usage of the “izer” and training tools is beyond the scope of this document. The [Workflow Guide](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/MaximAI_Documentation/blob/master/Guides/MAX78000_Workflow_Guide.md) is a great introduction, and the [Videos](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/microcontrollers/artificial-intelligence.html/tab4) dive deeper.

Additionally, the [README](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis/blob/develop/README.md) contains all of the usage information for the tools.

Below are a few excercises to get started after setup is complete:

* Run the `gen-demos-max78002.sh` script found in the root directory of the “izer” tool and reference its [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis#command-line-arguments-3) table to see how it works.

* Build and flash the output of one of the `gen-demos-max78002.sh` projects and verify that the generated “known answer” test passes.

* Locate the YAML files for the pre-trained models in the “izer” tool and reference the [YAML Network Description](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-synthesis#yaml-network-description) to see how they work.

* Run `train_all_models.sh` from the training repository and reference its [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-training#command-line-arguments) to see how it works.

* Familiarize yourself with the concept of data loaders with [Application Note 7600](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/7/7600.html) and explore the pre-written data loaders found in the [datasets](https://github.com/MaximIntegratedAI/ai8x-training/tree/develop/datasets) directory of the training tool.
